<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I started making websites in 8th grade during my Web Development class. That was 8 years ago and I've tinkered with
    it occasionally but ultimately lost the passion I once had.
    I remember how I would go around the class helping other students and how happy it made me. Coming to class and
    telling my teacher about a cool
    effect I made with JavaScript (notably how I got parallax scrolling to work) and him telling me to teach the class
    about it but I was too nervous.
</p>
<blockquote>I passionate until I was not.</blockquote>
<p> Well, I think that stuck with me because now I dream of teaching others how to code. However, there is an issue... I
    can't. Well not well enought to go around wasting others time on information that I have yet to master. </p>
<p>DRAFT</p>
<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>Motivation was always a big problem for me. I would make a website but then I would think it looks, runs, and feels terrible. So I would, gradually with every project, lose a little hope at ever becoming a real web developer. Until only a couple of weeks ago I decided to go back and look at some of the projects I have made. </p>
<p>I was surprised because in hindsight they didn't look all that bad and are quite impressive -- to me. I made a note taking application using Django and Auth0. I made a gif app with Express and MangoDB. I made a e-commerce website too. I don't know how I did any of that now and then it struck me.</p>
<blockquote>Why don't I start a website about programming everyday? Give myself a challenge and reference points to look back on my progress. I can also fulfill my dream a little bit of teaching others by designing this website around an educational model.</blockquote>
<p>So, here we are now my first post of 222! I didn't want to make this solely a website with posts about my learnings and obstacles. I wanted to make it a <strong>resource</strong> for aspiring web developers who are also lacking motivation, unclear of their path, or looking for tips.</p>
