<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I started making websites in 8th grade during my Web Development class. That was 8 years ago and I've tinkered with
    it occasionally but ultimately lost the passion I once had.
    I remember how I would go around the class helping other students and how happy it made me. Coming to class and
    telling my teacher about a cool
    effect I made with JavaScript (notably how I got parallax scrolling to work) and him telling me to teach the class
    about it but I was too nervous.
</p>
<blockquote>I was passionate until I was not.</blockquote>
<p> Well, I think that stuck with me because now I <strong>dream</strong> of teaching others how to code. However, there is an issue... <strong>I
    can't.</strong> Well not well enough to go around wasting others time on information that I have yet to master. </p>
<h3>About this site</h3>
<p>Motivation was always a big problem for me. I would make a website but then I would think it looks, runs, and feels terrible. So I would, gradually with every project, lose a little hope at ever becoming a real web developer. Until only a couple of weeks ago I decided to go back and look at some of the projects I have made. </p>
<p>I was surprised because in hindsight they didn't look all that bad and are quite impressive -- to me. I made a note taking application using Django and Auth0. I made a gif app with Express and MangoDB. I made a e-commerce website too. I don't know how I did any of that now and then it struck me.</p>
<blockquote>"Why don't I start a website about programming everyday? Give myself a challenge and reference points to look back on my progress. I can also fulfill my dream a little bit of teaching others by designing this website around an educational model."</blockquote>
<p>So, here we are now my first post of 222! I didn't want to make this solely a website with posts about my learnings and obstacles. I wanted to make it a <strong>resource</strong> for aspiring web developers who are also:</p>
<ul>
    <li>lacking motivation</li>
    <li>unclear of their path</li>
    <li>need tips</li>
</ul>
<p>What better way to start off these 222 days than talking about the foundation of web development?</p>
<h2>Why care about computer networks?</h2>
<p>When you visit a website what happens? How does a set of texts, images, fonts, videos, etc. suddenly appear on your screen? Is it wizardry and <strong>why</strong> is it important for web developers to learn? Shouldn't web developers focus their attention on how to create websites not how they are loaded into a browser?</p>
<p>All valid questions that ultimately lead to one answer...</p> 
<blockquote>It's important to have a strong foundation of the engine you are working on.</blockquote>
<p>In my limited experience as a web developer there are two types of websites one can make:</p>
<ul>
    <li>static websites</li>
    <li>dynamic websites</li>
</ul>
<p>As a <strong>beginner</strong> you will be largely making <strong>static websites</strong> which involve little to <strong>zero</strong> knowledge about computer networks. As you progress, however, you may want to <strong>update</strong> the <strong>content</strong> of your website based on specific <strong>conditions</strong> from <strong>data/information delivered</strong> from a server.</p>
<p>Websites that update their content based on conditions from the data received from a server are called <strong>dynamic websites</strong> and make up most of the websites you interact with in your day to day life.</p>
<p>As a web developer you are going to be writing JavaScript code that makes requests to servers for data/information like so:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">// get html element that contains all the posts</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> posts <span class="token operator">=</span> document<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">querySelector</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"#posts"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">data</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

        <span class="token comment">// create html element to display post description on webpage</span>

        <span class="token comment">// add post to html webpage</span>

    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></code></pre>
<p>Now depending on your experience with web development, the code above may seem like gibberish. I have bad news... it will get even more complicated than that as you will have to deal with request headers, actions, body data, etc. Then you'll have to prepare for different server response codes!</p>
<p>So, learning about computer networks is imperative to being a successful web developer! Let's start with defining what a computer network is!</p>
<h2>A high-level view of computer networks</h2>
<figure>
    <img src="/222dof/vectors/network-example.png" alt="">
    <figcaption>Simple depiction of a computer network.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A <strong>computer network</strong> is a system that allows computing devices to communicate with each other. To provide a practical example, say you are using a laptop that is connected to a router. That laptop and other devices connected to the router are part of a web known as a computer network.</p> 
<h3>They can communicate with each other, but how?</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier a computer network allows computing devices to communicate with each other. In order for this to occur the computing devices on the network <strong>must speak the same language</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly to how in order for humans to understand each other we must speak or understand the same language.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Computing devices on a computer network must use a <strong>common communications protocol</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol" target="_blank" class="clickable"><small>(wiki.)</small></a>
        <ul>
            <li>Communications protocol = set of rules that describe how information is to be exchanged between entities</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>The Internet</h3>
<figure class="figure-float-right">
    <img src="/222dof/vectors/internet-example.svg" alt="">
    <figcaption>Simple depiction of the Internet.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We've established that in a computer network you can communicate with other devices also in the same network. But, what if we want to communicate with devices outside our network?</p>
<p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is, to put it succinctly, a <strong>network of networks</strong>. This means its a system in which computer networks can communicate with each other. To be more specific, the Internet is a globally connected set of computer networks that all use a suite of common protocols.</p>
<h3>Deeper look at the parts of a computer network</h3>
<p><strong>Hosts/Nodes</strong> are single computing devices attached to a network. Hosts can have different purposes in a network similarly to how humans have different purposes -- albeit hosts don't have nearly as much options. A host can <strong>act</strong> as a <strong>server</strong>, <strong>client</strong>, or <strong>both</strong>!</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Server</strong> is a host that listens for inbound network connections and provides services to other hosts.</li>
    <li><strong>Client</strong> is a host that makes outbound network connections and requests services from network servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to realize that any computer (host) can be a server as long as it has the appropriate software (instructions). Therefore, when thinking of a server don't think it's some magical computing device. As your own laptop can be a server if adjusted correctly.</p>
<p>Some computing devices are constructed specifically to act as servers as a normal laptop wouldn't be powerful or efficient enough to handle large requests. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)" target="_blank" class="clickable"><small>(wiki.)</small></a></p>
<blockquote>A client makes a request to a server and a server replies with a response.</blockquote>
<h2>Communicating on and across networks</h2>
<p>So far, we have looked at what a computer network is and the parts such as clients and servers. But we have yet to describe how these hosts communicate with each other on their own networks and across networks.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier computing devices must speak the same language -- use a common communciations protocol. The <strong>Internet Protocol Suite</strong> is a standardized framework for communciation on the Internet. The IPS ensures that computing devices on a computer network speak the language.</p>
<figure class="figure-float-right">
    <img src="/222dof/vectors/ips.png" alt="">
    <figcaption>The Internet Protocol Suite.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So if a device wants to communicate on the internet it is most likely going to utilize the Internet Protocol Suite to do so. One should note that a name that is sometimes used to refer to the four layer network model the Internet Protocol Suite is designed around is called <strong>TCP/IP model</strong>.</p>
<h3>Network Stacks</h3>
<p>The TCP/IP model refers to the four layer model the Internet Protocl Suite is designed around but what is a network stack? A <strong>network stack</strong> is a layered model of network protocols.</p>
<blockquote>A layer in a network stack reprsents a scope of responsibilities that are fulfilled by the protocols in the layer.</blockquote>
<p>Protocols in the lowest layers interact with networking hardware. Protocols in intermediate layers provide services (routing, addressing). Protocols in the upper layers interact with applications.</p>
<h3>Deeper look at the TCP/IP model</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the TCP/IP model is a four layer model that the IPS is designed around and network layers represent a scope of responsbilities that are fulfilled by the protocols in those layers. What are the responsbilities of the layers in the TCP/IP model?</p>
<p>The TCP/IP model is compromised of the following layers:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Application
        <ul>
            <li>Protocols provide application specific functionality by structuring the data used in process-to-process communication across a network.</li>
            <li>Protocols <strong>used</strong>: HTTP, SSH</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Transport
        <ul>
            <li>Protocols provide a communications channel for applications to send/receive data between hosts.</li>
            <li>Protocols <strong>used</strong>: TCP, UDP</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Internet
        <ul>
            <li>Protocols provide a way to communicate across networks. This layer is responsible for identifying hosts with addresses and enabling the routing of data from network to network across the internet.</li>
            <li>Protocols <strong>used</strong>: IP</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Link
        <ul>
            <li>Protocols provide a way to communicate on a local network.</li>
            <li>Protocols <strong>used</strong>: Wi-Fi, Ethernet</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Fin</h2>
<p>I think that is enough information for one post. Words can't express how excited -- word used to express... -- I am to start this journey. This time programming feels right and I feel motivated more than ever.</p>
<p>Computer networks are imperative to being a web developer and they are also cool to learn about. The <strong>post</strong> on <strong>12/24/2024</strong> will be a direct <strong>sequel</strong> to this post or <strong>part-two</strong> if you will.</p>
